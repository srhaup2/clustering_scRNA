# scRNA dimensionality reduction and clustering

This is a project for the class Biostat 615 (Statistical Computing). In this package, we implement dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques to be evaluated on scRNA data. Specifically, we implement sparse PCA, different variants of k-means clustering, and refinements for the EM algorithm for a Gaussian mixture model. 


Here is a link to our [Colab page](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1B7R8pFiWbro3YiGQASe1TR8jkKVuXGa1#scrollTo=eWwnZKsKdATZ) showing examples of how to use and evaluate our package.
