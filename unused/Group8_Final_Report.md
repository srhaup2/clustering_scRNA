Submit your final project report and the code.

Your canvas submission must include a written report (25 points) with <5,000 words. The report is expected to provide a brief introduction of the project, description of the problem to be solved, description of the algorithms, evaluation of the results at the minimum. You may include display items such as figures and tables, and the total length should be no longer than 5 pages (and the expected length is 3 pages).

Submit your report as a PDF file. 

A recommended way to submit your code (50 points) is to host your package in a public GitHub repository. Users should be able to install your package using devtools::install_github("username/repositoryname"), your report simply needs to include the URL for the repository in the first page of your report. As previously announced, the code will be grade based on novelty (30%), difficulty (30%), and the degree of completion (40%).

If you cannot host a GitHub repository, you need to include the source code of the R package (.tar.gz) in this submission. In such as case, make a zip file containing both the PDF file and the package in your submission.
